            <p><strong><span>A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. <strong>For more information, including information about additional rights, go to </strong></span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><strong><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></strong><span>, </span></a><strong><span>or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</span></strong></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong><span>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you</span></strong><span>. Anyone <span>who </span>uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment -- or to take another adverse action against you -- must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the </span></li>
            <li><strong><span>You have the right to know what is in your file</span></strong><span>. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your "file disclosure"). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include <span>your </span>Social Security Number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free. You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:</span>
            <ul>
            <li><span>a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report;</span></li>
            <li><span>you are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file;</span></li>
            <li><span>your file contains inaccurate information as a result <span>of</span> fraud;</span></li>
            <li><span>you are on public assistance;</span></li>
            <li><span>you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 </span></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>In addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies.&nbsp; See&nbsp; </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</span></a><span>for additional information.</span></p>

            <li><strong><span>You have the right to ask for a credit score</span></strong><span>. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</span></li>
            <li><strong><span>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information</span></strong><span>. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>consumerfinance.gov/learnmore </span></a><span>for an explanation of dispute procedures.</span></li>
            <li><strong><span>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information</span></strong><span>. Inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 However a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</span></li>
            <li><strong><span>Consumer reporting agencies <span>may </span>not report outdated negative information</span></strong><span>. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span><strong><span>Access to your file is limited</span></strong><span>. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about <span>you</span> only to people with a valid need - usually to consider an</span></span></p>
            <p><span>application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong><span>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers</span></strong><span>.

            <p><span>You are receiving this information because you have notified a consumer reporting agency that you believe that you are a victim of identity theft. Identity theft occurs when someone uses your name, Social Security Number, date of birth, or other identifying information, without authority, to commit fraud. For example, someone may have committed identity theft by using your personal information to open a credit card account or get a loan in your name. For more information, visit </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore </span></a><span>or write to: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 1700 G Street N.W., Washington, DC 20552.</span></p>
            <p><span>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives you specific rights when you are, or believe that you are, the victim of identity theft. Here is a brief summary of the rights designed to help you recover from identity theft.</span></p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong><span>You have the right to ask the nationwide consumer reporting agencies place "fraud alerts" in your file to let potential creditors and others know that you may be a victim <span>of </span>identity theft</span></strong><span>. A fraud alert can make it more difficult for someone to get credit in your name because it tells creditors to follow certain procedures to protect you. It also may delay your ability to obtain credit. You may place a fraud alert in your file by calling just one of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies. As soon as that agency processes your fraud alert, it will notify the other two, which then also must place fraud alerts in your </span>

            </li>
            </ol>
            <p><span>An <u>initial fraud alert </u>stays in your file for at least 90 days. An <u>extended alert </u>stays in your file for seven years. To place either of these alerts, a consumer reporting agency will require you to provide appropriate proof of your identity, which may include your Social Security Number. If you ask for an <u>extended alert</u>, you will have to provide an <u>identity theft report</u>. An <u>identity theft report </u>includes a copy of a report you have filed with a federal, state, or local law enforcement agency, and additional information a consumer reporting agency may require you to submit. For more detailed information about the <u>identity theft report, </u>visit </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft"><span>www.consumerfinance.gov/</span></a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft"><span>learnmore</span><span>.</span></a></p>
            <ol start="2">
            <li><strong><span>You have the right to free copies of the information in your file (your "file disclosure"). </span></strong><span>An <u>initial fraud alert </u>entitles you to a copy of all information in your file at each of the three nationwide agencies, and an <u>extended alert </u>entitles you to two free file disclosures in a 12-month period following the placing <span>of </span>the alert. These additional disclosures may help you detect signs of fraud, for example, whether fraudulent accounts have been opened in your name or whether someone has reported a change in your address. Once a year, you also have the right to a free copy of the information in your file at any consumer reporting agency, if you believe it has inaccurate information due to fraud, such as identity theft. You also have the ability to obtain additional free file disclosures under other provisions of the FCRA. See </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore"><span>consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.</span></a></li>
            <li><strong><span>You have the right to obtain documents relating to fraudulent transactions made or accounts opened using your personal </span></strong><span>A creditor or other business must give you copies of applications and other business records relating to transactions and accounts that resulted from the theft of your identity, if you ask for them in writing. A business may ask you for proof of your identity, a police report, and an affidavit before giving you the documents. It also may specify an address for you to send <span>your </span>request. Under certain circumstances, a business can refuse to provide you with these documents.
